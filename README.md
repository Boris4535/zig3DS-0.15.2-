So, when someone doesnt have their plate already too full, what best time than to pick up other projects and/or interests?
I've known beforehand of devkitpro, and with my newfound interest for zig, i went thru the hurdle of using the language to develop 2DS games.

Now, i wasnt gonna reinvent the wheel and of the sort, so... devkitpro libraries happen to be exeptionally good at this.
How do i link everything together? 
It was painful to figure out at first, then i did what *should* have been done first, and i looked up what the rest of the internet has been up to.
And, i found the original repo from user "Knarkzel", i believe.
From 2022, which was a good way to start off, and i took great inspo from it, especially the usage of c.zig, and the more refined libc.txt.

Mr. Erikwastaken was also of great help, and with all of this, i managed to put together the code in 0.15.2.

now, in the release note in another file, i will actually write out what has changed and how it behaves... i believe its far from perfect, but it works!

FOR QUESTIONS, GO TO THE DISCUSSION SIDE OF THINGS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
